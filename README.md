# Restful API with Axum

This project is a personal, self-directed learning endeavor built with Rust and Axum. It’s designed as a sandbox to experiment with asynchronous programming, robust routing, and error handling—all in a type-safe and performance-oriented environment. Use this project as your playground to understand key web development concepts, build practical RESTful APIs, and progressively sharpen your Rust skills.
